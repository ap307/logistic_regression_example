# Reproducing results of Logistic Regression

Based on an Jupyter Notebook on the scikit-learn website (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto\_examples/linear\_model/plot\_iris\_logistic.html)

- Fit a logistic regression to classify one of three outcomes based on 2 features

- Took the outputs of the regression - coefficients and intercept - and attempted to recalculate the outcome probabilities

- Compared the recalculated outcome probabilities with those output by LogisticRegression()

- The calculated probabilities do not match the module outputs
